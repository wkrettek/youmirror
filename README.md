# youmirror
Youmirror is an archiving tool built on pytube for creating and managing a mirror of your favorite youtube videos

## Installation

You can install from github by using

`pip install git+https://github.com/wkrettek/youmirror.git`

You can also git clone this repository and install with poetry

## Description

There are a lot of sites out there that will let you paste a youtube link and download a youtube video relatively quickly. You can even use pytube to download youtube videos relatively quickly. But writing a script to manage all this downloading is time-consuming and one-offs don't really make a consistent management system. This library is designed to address that issue.

With youmirror and the accompanying CLI you can spin up an archive filetree and quickly add videos with a single link!

## CLI

You can easily interact with youmirror using the command line tool. Create a new mirror with the
`new` command, optionally specifying the folder.

`youmirror new [folder]`

You can add to your mirror by using the add command with a link like by using `add`. If you don't specify the folder, it will search the current directory for a config file

`youmirror add "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa_HT9vQiLw&t=4s" [folder]`



Conversely you can remove from the mirror with

`youmirror remove "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa_HT9vQiLw&t=4s" [folder]`

You can view the current state of your mirror with the `show` command

`youmirror show [folder]`

youmirror also offers a `sync` command to update your mirror if you have say a playlist that you added more videos to or if an `add` command got stopped short and you want to make sure the files got downloaded

`youmirror sync [folder]`

## Organization

youmirror does all the organization and filetree-building so you don't have to. Here is what the filetree looks like from a high level:

```
   Root
    | -- channels
            | -- channel name
                    | -- single name
                            | -- files
    | -- playlists
            | -- playlist name
                    | -- single name
                            | -- files
    | -- singles
            | -- single name
                    | -- files
```
            
You may notice that I use the term 'single' to refer to a single youtube video. This is leaning into the fact that there is a lot of information that can be downloaded from a youtube video, this includes downloading the audio separately, or downloading the captions


## Downloading

youmirror offers best-effort downloading. This means youmirror will attempt to download the best quality stream that matches your request. By default, youmirror will download at 720p if available. If 720p is not available, it will download the next best resolution for the video. 

You can specify higher resolutions if you prefer, but Youtube does not serve higher res streams with combined audio, so if a higher resolution is specified, youmirror will find the highest quality audio stream and attempt to combine it with the video using `ffmpeg`. If you don't have `ffmpeg`, you can download it [here].(https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) It's not required, so you can download videos at up to 720p without it.

## Configuration

Similar to poetry, youmirror uses a .toml config file to keep track of what's in your mirror. Tom's Obvious Minimal Language is designed to be a more human readable text system, as opposed to JSON or XML. So, if you ever want to, you can open the .toml file and get a pretty good idea of what is in your mirror.
