### core
    The local config for each url needs to persist between syncs (url's config gets loaded when it syncs)
    Generate Keys does some weird stuff that people might not understand

### printer
    Figure out how to put stuff in columns
    Add Color
    [1] show name, type, url, num children, size

### Databaser
    Need to start verifying the configuration down to the files and the files up to the configuration (preferably on bootup)

### Downloader
    Download is best effort but logic could maybe be simplified a bit
    Still getting xml errors when converting captions. I need to do this in-house
        Maybe xml captions could be a download option? idk
