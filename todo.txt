core
    utilize cache more
    start wrapping up some of the repeated functionality
        simplify top level core code as much as possible so it's easier to troubleshoot things

Downloader
    Download is best effort but maybe could be simplified a bit
    Download specified resolution and combine audio with ffmpeg?
        --I'm doing this rn. Have to validation test a lot and make sure it doens't call ffmpeg if they don't have it
    Download audio could take a specified bitrate
    If there is an exception when downloading a file, print it and skip
        Don't stop till you get to the end
    Still getting xml errors when converting captions. I need to do this in-house
    
printer
    [1] show name, type, url, num children, size
    Do some basic formatting

cli
    remove
        When removing singles, it will calculate 0B for the path
    check
        Looks through all the playlists and channels
            Finds children
            If there are new children
                Add them to the database

Databaser
    Need to put lots and lots of keys in the database because we can easily remove them later if unused,
    but can't easily put new ones in
    Wrap up the databasing as much as possible to abstract it from database implementation
        using sqlitedict for now
    If I change the databasing, the database will still send the core a dict no matter what
