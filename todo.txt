    setup
    api
        add
        remove
        sync

cli
    add
        be able to add multiple urls
        can specify dry run
    show
        show current state of database
            [1] list all channels, playlists, 
    
printer
    [1] show name, type, url, num children, size

Parser
    Be able to rip all the metadata
        Somehow rip just enough not to cause any errors.. I guess just skip metadata we can't get that's not crucial
    for get_keys():
        resolve collision is maybe a database thing?

Helper
    --- I changed the filetree to what df said which makes sense
    How to differentiate audio files from video files when they are both mp4?
    Remove spaces from filenames?
    Calculate the size of the file additions and send to printer before downloading

Databaser
    Wrap up the databasing as much as possible to abstract it from database implementation
        using sqlitedict for now

Downloader
    --- For now I will just provide defaults and deal with the other more crucial parts of the tool, like showing is actually really important
    Download should be best effort to match (video) resolution
    Audio should be just default quality, idk if I will really provide any specifiers
    Download specified resolution and combine audio with ffmpeg?
    There's actually a lot of nuance that can go into this, but the top level api has to be better at passing down the required info to handle different downloading situations
