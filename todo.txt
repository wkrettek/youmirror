    
printer
    [1] show name, type, url, num children, size
    Do some basic formatting

cli
    remove
        ------ WE FUCKING FINALLY FINISHED IT
    check
        Looks through all the playlists and channels
            Finds children
            If there are new children
                Add them to the database
    sync
        Start this after remove
        Be able to specify more options
            Like resolution
    add

Parser
    Be able to rip all the metadata
        Somehow rip just enough not to cause any errors.. I guess just skip metadata we can't get that's not crucial
    for get_keys():
        resolve collision is maybe a database thing?

Helper
    Remove spaces from filenames?
    Calculate the size of the file additions and send to printer before downloading

Databaser
    Files will now be stored as dictionary {"audio": [""], "video": [""], "captions": ["_en","_a.en"]}
    When downloading, at to files table the type, "video", "audio" etc. and the resolution and bit rate
    Do all commits at once no matter what
        Have to make this happen for filetree integrity
            Or I guess I could just do a check every time if it's been added?
                Or I could revert like poetry does?
    Wrap up the databasing as much as possible to abstract it from database implementation
        using sqlitedict for now
    If a file cannot be downloaded. Mark it as not downloaded or something


Downloader
    Download is best effort but maybe could be simplified a bit
    Download specified resolution and combine audio with ffmpeg?
        --I'm doing this rn. Have to validation test a lot and make sure it doens't call ffmpeg if they don't have it
    Download audio could take a specified bitrate
