    
printer
    [1] show name, type, url, num children, size
    Do some basic formatting

cli
    remove
        finish it up
    sync
        Start this after remove
    Be able to specify more options
        Like resolution
    add
        be able to add multiple urls
        can specify dry run

Parser
    Be able to rip all the metadata
        Somehow rip just enough not to cause any errors.. I guess just skip metadata we can't get that's not crucial
    for get_keys():
        resolve collision is maybe a database thing?

Helper
    --- I changed the filetree to what df said which makes sense
    How to differentiate audio files from video files when they are both mp4?
    Remove spaces from filenames?
    Calculate the size of the file additions and send to printer before downloading

Databaser
    Do all commits at once no matter what
        Have to make this happen for filetree integrity
            Or I guess I could just do a check every time if it's been added?
                Or I could revert like poetry does?
    Wrap up the databasing as much as possible to abstract it from database implementation
        using sqlitedict for now


Downloader
    --- For now I will just provide defaults and deal with the other more crucial parts of the tool, like showing is actually really important
    Download should be best effort to match (video) resolution
    Audio should be just default quality, idk if I will really provide any specifiers
    Download specified resolution and combine audio with ffmpeg?
    There's actually a lot of nuance that can go into this, but the top level api has to be better at passing down the required info to handle different downloading situations
