Databaser
    Need to start doing verification checks 
    Wrap up the databasing as much as possible to abstract it from database implementation
        using sqlitedict for now
    If I change the databasing, the database will still send the core a dict no matter what

core
    Finish remove()
        Then do update()
    Have to organize and document the new wrapped up functions

Downloader
    Download is best effort but maybe could be simplified a bit
    Download audio could take a specified bitrate
    Still getting xml errors when converting captions. I need to do this in-house
        Maybe xml captions could be a download option? idk
