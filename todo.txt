Parser
    Be able to rip all the metadata
        Somehow rip just enough not to cause any errors.. I guess just skip metadata we can't get that's not crucial
    for get_keys():
        resolve collision is maybe a database thing?
Helper
    Can I rename this thing??
    --- I changed the filetree type back to tall by default
Databaser
    Wrap up the databasing as much as possible to abstract it from database implementation
        using sqlitedict for now
Downloader
    Calculate all the filepaths before hand, only download at the very end
    Should be very specific
        You only pass video objects when you're ready to download
        Somehow have to be able to pass all the different specifiers
