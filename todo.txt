Databaser
    ---- Heavily considering using the url as the primary key for the yt databases ----- DONE
    Wrap up the databasing as much as possible to abstract it from database implementation
        using sqlitedict for now
    If I change the databasing, the database will still send the core a dict no matter what

core
    start wrapping up some of the repeated functionality
        Wanna wrap up the filesize calculating and the downloading
        wrap up grabbing the options and verifying the config

Downloader
    Download is best effort but maybe could be simplified a bit
    Download audio could take a specified bitrate
    If there is an exception when downloading a file, print it and skip
        Don't stop till you get to the end
    Still getting xml errors when converting captions. I need to do this in-house
    
printer
    [1] show name, type, url, num children, size
    Do some basic formatting

cli
    remove
        When removing singles, it will calculate 0B for the path
